# User-CLI-UIX-UX-Visual-Enhancement
I’ve implemented a custom cursor as a demonstration of my ability to manipulate the DOM and handle real-time input tracking. To ensure a professional experience, it is optimized for high-refresh-rate displays and respects the system's prefers-reduced-motion settings.
Enhanced User Interaction Study
A mindful exploration of custom cursor states and accessibility-first UI.**

  The "Why"
This project isn't just a visual gag. It's an assessment of how custom interaction models can be implemented while respecting user autonomy.

  Key Professional Features:
Accessibility Toggle: Users can opt-out of the custom experience via a persistent UI toggle.
GPU Optimized: Uses CSS transform: translate3  to prevent layout reflows and maintain 60FPS.
 Separation of Concerns: Clean decoupling of CSS-in-JS logic for easier maintainability.
