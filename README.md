### 🧐 The "Why"
This project isn't just a visual gag. It's an assessment of how custom interaction models can be implemented while respecting user autonomy.

### 🛠️ Key Professional Features:
* **Accessibility Toggle:** Users can opt-out of the custom experience via a persistent UI toggle.
* **GPU Optimized:** Uses CSS `transform: translate3d` to prevent layout reflows and maintain 60FPS.
* **Separation of Concerns:** Clean decoupling of CSS-in-JS logic for easier maintainability.
# User-CLI-UIX-UX-Visual-Enhancement
